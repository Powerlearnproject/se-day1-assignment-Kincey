#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering refers to the processes of creating software systems in order that they are well functioning, capable of meeting the users’ needs and retrievable for modifications.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Structured Programming
Structured programming came up with the concept of packagning code into small understandable modules like an object. Earlier, programs were rather disordered and therefore gave less clues on the whole.

2. Object-Oriented Programming 
Object-Oriented Programming is a way in which you organize the code and create programs, where the reference point of the programs is selected items in the real world such as a car or a bank account. Every implemented object has attributes (such as colour or incorporating) and behaviours (for example drive or withdrawing cash).

3. Agile Development
Agile is a technique used in software development where new and modified software is developed and enhanced through successive short cycles. The approach is different and reflects a considerable emphasis on flexibility, cooperation with the customer, and the ability to act swiftly in response to changes.


List and briefly plain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning
During this phase, the overall objectives, the activities that will be performed, and available resources required to complete the project are identified. It implies incorporating stakeholders’ needs to determine what the software is supposed to do and develop a strategy of how the development is going to be executed.

3. Design
This phase constitutes the conception of the whole look of the software, the front end, the back end and the general architecture.

4. Implementation 
Actual coding is done by developers according to the design that has been put in place. This is a place where the software is develop and the attributes are incorporated.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Flexibility: The Waterfall is not very flexible and can only executed in a linear manner where one phase has to be done before the next phase is done. The problem with this arrangement is that it becomes cumbersome to implement changes after a phase has been completed. On the other hand, Agile is, in terms of flexibility very open for alterations and modifications during the development phase.

Process Flow: Waterfall follows a sequential system; that is, it is achieved simply through a series of stages. All these phases are done sequentially, one after another – with no parallel progression. While water is sequential, with work performed in stages, Agile is more cyclic, with work done in spirals known as, “sprints.

Documentation: Waterfall places a lot of stock in documentation at each phase, particularly the blueprint phase. This serves to make certain that all aspects of the project are well thought before the actual development process is initiated. Agile does not rely heavily on documentation as part of the process and it seeks to provide working software that meets the stakeholders’ needs and also engages the members of the development team.

Risk Management: Risk in Waterfall methodology is pointed out and controlled during the initial stage of the project with very little chance of an alteration in the middle of the project. Agile helps in testing since testing can be started in an early stage and done continuously which help in reducing large risks that would have been generated at a later stage in a project.

Scenarios for Use:

Waterfall Examples: Waterfall is appropriate for a situation where the specifications of the project are easy to define and unchangeable. For instance, creating a payroll system for a big company, where the requirements are more or less clear, or designing an element base for a medical device, where all the requirements are formalized and the documentation is to be precise.

Agile Examples: It is recommended when one wants a flexible approach, and the project requirements are constantly changing or required to be updated often. For instance, creating a mobile app for a startup in which users’ reactions may mean changes every now and then, or designing a website for an online store that has to be adjusted to consumers and trends.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer
Coding: Develop the actual programme that software is composed of by coding, doing trials and then fixing. This include the development of new functionality, eradication of defects as well as the enhancement of efficiency and quality of the software produced.
Design: Work with others to integrate the different aspects of the software system, determine how various components of the system are to be constructed. It may entail developing of certain algorithms, data structure, and architecture.
Collaboration: Cooperate with other team members of developers, designers, and quality assurance engineers, to identify whether the software is meeting the set standards and is properly coded.
Code Review: Contribute to the code reviews in order to make sure that quality of the produced code is high and reflects all necessary standards.

2. Quality Assurance Engineer
Testing: Perform and communicate assessments with respect to functionality of the developed software to meet design and development requirements. These are unit testing, integration testing, system testing and user acceptance testing just to mention but a few.
Bug Reporting: Report on the bugs or defects discovered when it is being tested. QA engineers liaise with the developers to fix such problems Checking and verification of features are some of the responsibilities of a QA engineer with software development companies.
Automation: Create and sustain a set of automated test cases that can with great ease and effectiveness test the software especially regression testing.

3. Project Manager
Planning: Specify the role of the project, its goals and the what the project aims to achieve. Prepare documentation that is sufficient in order to define work breakdown, schedule, resources, and costs.
Team Coordination: Manage the team of software engineers; ensure that the developers, QA engineers and the rest of the team are working to the objectives of the project and in harmony.
Stakeholder Communication: Act as the interface of the project for the core working team and projects sponsors (e. g. clients and top management). Communicate with the stakeholders on the progress, risks and any changes in the project.
Risk Management: For each of the risks mentioned in the list above make a proposal that would help avoid/overcome it. This involve handling emergent issues and change during the course of the project for the benefit of the plan.
Resource Management: Five: Assign manpower, machinery, and financial to reduce vulnerability and maintain the project on the right path.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
Importance:

Code Editing: Provides features like syntax highlighting and auto-completion.
Debugging: Offers tools to find and fix bugs.
Project Management: Helps organize files and manage builds.
Tool Integration: Connects with other development tools.
Examples:

Visual Studio Code: Lightweight, extensible editor.
IntelliJ IDEA: Advanced Java IDE with strong language support.
Eclipse: Open-source, customizable IDE.
Version Control Systems (VCS)
Importance:

Code Management: Tracks and manages changes to code.
Collaboration: Supports multiple developers working together.
History Tracking: Records changes and who made them.
Branching/Merging: Allows working on features independently and merging them.
Examples:

Git: Distributed VCS, popular with GitHub and GitLab.
Subversion (SVN): Centralized VCS, good for single repository use.
Mercurial: Distributed VCS, known for ease of use.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Managing Complexity:

Challenge: Software systems can become complex, making it difficult to understand, maintain, and extend.
Strategy: Use modular design and clear architecture principles. Apply design patterns to solve common problems and keep code well-documented.
Dealing with Bugs and Errors:

Challenge: Bugs can be difficult to identify and fix, affecting software quality and development speed.
Strategy: Implement thorough testing practices, including unit tests, integration tests, and automated tests. Use debugging tools to trace and fix issues.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing
Definition:

In unit testing, elements of a software program, for example functions or methods, are tested independently of the rest of the system.
Importance:

Identifies Issues Early: It identifies them at a time when the components are developed and therefore becomes easier as well as cheaper to correct.”
Ensures Functionality: Checks that all units of code are correct to make certain that the separated components of the software function as planned.
Example:

Functionality testing to determine the total cost of items in a shopping cart.
2. Integration Testing
Definition:

Integration testing is targeted at the proper cooperation of the separate units or modules of the software product.
Importance:

Verifies Interactions: Checks that individual components link well with the other components, to notice any problem that results from incompatible combination of modules.
Detects Interface Issues: These can point out issues related to the communication and the data exchange between the different modules.
Example:

Verification of the integrated payment processing module with the inventory management system.
3. System Testing
Definition:

It involves testing of the entire and fully integrated S/W system to check whether the system meets the pre-negotiated specifications and operates properly in a live systemic mode.
Importance:

End-to-End Validation: I want to make sure that all components and all the integration and all the flow are perfect.
Ensures Compliance: Assesses the level in which functional and non-functional requirement have been met concerning the software’s performance ,security and usability.
Example:

Finally, testing of the majority of functions within the overall e-commerce application in order to verify that the users can browse through products, add items to the cart, and purchase them.
4. Acceptance Testing
Definition:

Acceptance testing is conducted to enable the business to decide whether it is ready to take the software, that is, whether it meets its needs. It is mostly performed by the end users or from the QA team, Whenever a software is developed.
Importance:

Validates Requirements: Refers to the fact that the software meets the user’s need and requirement as stipulated in the project scope.
Confirms Readiness: Controls and indicates if the software is ready for implementation and usage by the end users.
Example:

Acceptance testing where certain end-users or customers of the application test the new features of the software to see if they meet their requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering focuses on the design and refinement of the input prompts or queries that are used to feed the model especially GPT. To this end, the prompt should be well crafted in a manner that targets or gets the AI to give the most useful and accurate responses, as well as responses that are most relevant to the intended exchange.

Importance in Interacting with AI Models:Importance in Interacting with AI Models:

Improves Response Quality:

Explanation: Thus, well-designed prompts allow AI models to determine the particular context and intent of the given query more accurately and facilitate the retrieval of relevant answers.
Example: End of section question such as, “What are the implications of solar energy?” will attract more detail and elaborate information as compared to an open-ended question like “Explaining solar energy.”
Reduces Ambiguity:

Explanation: Direct and particular instructions reduce the number of discussions, which, in return, can confusing or unrelated with the AI.
Example: Compared to a rather general question such as ‘Can you speak about technology?’ or ‘What can you say about technology?’, the pointing question like ‘Can you explain how artificial intelligence affects healthcare?’ is much more directed.
Enhances Efficiency:

Explanation: About the authors Jon Brock is currently a PhD student at the Department of Psychology, Texas A&M University Himanshu Agarwal has completed his PhD from College of Information Science and Technology, University of Nebraska Omaha Dr Niranjan Suri is a Associate Professor and programme director of College of Information Science and Technology at University of Nebraska Omaha Dr Kristine Marohn is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Psychology at Texas A&M University Developed for the intelligent
Example: Open-ended questions should not be employed because they take a lot of time before the accurate information is received and in most cases; the respondent requires further clarification before providing the details needed.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: “Tell me about dogs.
Improved Prompt:

Improved Prompt: Compare and contrast the temperament and exercise requirements of Labrador retrievers and German shepherds.
Explanation of Improvement:

Clarity:

Unlike a broad topic of ‘dogs, ’ the improved prompt defines what breeds to write about: Labradors and German Shepherds.
Specificity:

However, it restricts the scope of discussion to such factors as ‘temperament’ and ‘exercise needs’, to which the response must pertain to specific aspects of the breeds of interest.
Conciseness:

The given prompt is clear and precise thus the AI will be able to make appropriate responses without having to go round in circles.
Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:

Focuses the Response: The change aims at strengthening the call to type in a query about one breed and search for the corresponding trait, as the enhanced prompt teaches the AI to give more targeted and precise response.
Enhances Relevance: Forcing the answer for the data that ‘what about temperament’ and ‘exercise needs’ guarantees that the answer is particular to particular characteristics, which makes it more helpful than a broad description of all dogs.
Saves Time: New and enhanced prompt minimizes confusion h and eliminates the probability of other follow-up questions hence enhancing the flow of information.
